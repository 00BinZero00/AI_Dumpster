### 1. Basic Packet Capture
To capture packets from a specific wireless interface, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0 -o capture.pcapng
```
- `-i wlan0` specifies the wireless interface you want to capture packets from.
- `-o capture.pcapng` specifies the output file for the captured packets.

### 2. Enable Monitor Mode
Before using `hcxdumptool`, ensure your wireless interface is in monitor mode. You can enable monitor mode using `airmon-ng` or `iw`:

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

### 3. Capture Handshakes
To capture WPA/WPA2 handshakes, you can use the command with additional options:

```bash
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0 -o capture.pcapng --enable_status=1
```
- `--enable_status=1` provides status updates on packet capture, which is helpful for monitoring progress.

### 4. Filter by SSID
If you're interested in capturing packets from a specific SSID, you can use the `--filter` option:

```bash
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0 -o capture.pcapng --filter=MyNetworkSSID
```
- Replace `MyNetworkSSID` with the actual SSID of the network you want to capture from.

### 5. Use with hcxpcapngtool
After capturing packets, you can convert the `.pcapng` file to a format suitable for password cracking:

```bash
hcxpcapngtool -o output.16800 capture.pcapng
```
- `-o output.16800` specifies the output file for the converted format.

### 6. Use with Hashcat
Once you have the output file, you can use Hashcat to crack the captured handshakes:

```bash
hashcat -m 22000 output.16800 wordlist.txt
```
- Replace `wordlist.txt` with the path to your password list.

### 7. Monitor Status
You can monitor the status of the capture process in real-time:

```bash
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0 -o capture.pcapng --enable_status=1 --enable_status=1 --enable_hc2
```
- The `--enable_hc2` option will show additional status information.

### 8. Capture Specific Packet Types
You can specify the types of packets you want to capture. For example, if you only want to capture EAPOL packets:

```bash
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0 -o capture.pcapng --enable_eapol=1
```

### 9. Save to Multiple Files
If you want to save captured packets to multiple files based on size, you can specify a maximum file size:

```bash
sudo hcxdumptool -i wlan0 -o capture.pcapng --max_file_size=1000000
```
- This will create new files once the specified size (in bytes) is reached.

### 10. Use With a Specific Channel
If you want to capture packets on a specific channel, you can set the channel using the `iw` command before running `hcxdumptool`:

```bash
sudo iw dev wlan0 set channel 6
```
- Then run the `hcxdumptool` command as usual.
